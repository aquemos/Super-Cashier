# Super-Cashier
Super Cashier is a program created to fulfill the completion of my course on Analytics and Data Science course at Pacmann.

## Problems Background
The super cashier program is created to help my friend, Andi (supermarket owner) in managing transactions at his supermarket. This program allows customers to make purchases independently by adding items to the shopping cart and calculating the total price of items in their cart.

## Requirements
The Super Cashier program requires the following features:
- Generate a transaction ID when a customer initiates a transaction.
- Allow customers to add items to the shopping cart.
- Allow customers to update the name, price, and quantity of items in the shopping cart.
- Allow customers to remove items from the shopping cart.
- Allow customers to clear the entire shopping cart.
- Display the contents of the shopping cart.
- Calculate the total purchase price, including applicable discounts. The discount rules are as follows:
  + If the total purchase amount exceeds Rp. 200,000, apply a 5% discount.
  + If the total purchase amount exceeds Rp. 300,000, apply an 8% discount.
  + If the total purchase amount exceeds Rp. 500,000, apply a 10% discount.
- Provide error messages for user input errors.
