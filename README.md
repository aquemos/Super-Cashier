# Super-Cashier
Super Cashier is a program created to fulfill the completion of my course on Analytics and Data Science course at Pacmann.

## Problems Background
Andi, the owner of a supermarket, wants to implement a self-service cashier system for his store. With this self-service system, customers will be able to calculate their total purchases independently. Andi needs help from a programmer to make this self-service cashier.

## Requirements
The self-service cashier requires the following features:
- Generate a transaction ID when a customer initiates a transaction.
- Allow customers to add items to the shopping cart.
- Allow customers to update the name, price, and quantity of items in the shopping cart.
- Allow customers to remove items from the shopping cart.
- Allow customers to clear the entire shopping cart.
- Display the contents of the shopping cart.
- Calculate the total purchase price, including applicable discounts. The discount rules are as follows:
  + If the total purchase amount exceeds Rp. 200,000, apply 5% discount.
  + If the total purchase amount exceeds Rp. 300,000, apply 8% discount.
  + If the total purchase amount exceeds Rp. 500,000, apply 10% discount.
- Provide error messages for user input errors.

## Flowchart
This section explains the flowchart for creating the self-service cashier, which will be referred to as the **Super Cashier**.
The flowchart consists of several sub-flowcharts, namely the main menu, add item, update item name, update item price, update item quantity, delete an item, delete all items in the cart, show cart, and calculate total.
